The memo distributed on June 27 on Reimbursement of Individually Billed Items 
requires
clarification.  The intent of the memo was to give employees an alternate 
method
of paying for pagers, cell phones, etc.  Employees can continue to submit 
these
invoices to Accounts Payable for processing or  pay these items with their 
corporate
American Express card and request reimbursement through an expense report.  
Either
way is an acceptable way to process these small dollar high volume invoices.
